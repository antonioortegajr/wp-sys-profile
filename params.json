Private route looks for a key passed in the request headers. OAuth is probably better, but this might make this plugin useful for larger scale support where getting information quickly with a little customer effort is valuable.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO sensitive information (usernames, passwords, etc...) is passed in the public route.\r\n\r\nSome is in ONLY the private route.\r\n\r\nIf you need to report further sensitive information feel free to fork this repo.\r\n\r\nDisplays the following information:\r\n\r\n* URL\r\n* Server type\r\n* PHP Version\r\n* PHP mem limit\r\n* MySQL version\r\n* cURL enabled\r\n* WordPress Version\r\n* Encoding\r\n* WP mem limit\r\n* WP max mem limit\r\n* Permalink structure\r\n* Is a MultiSite\r\n* Current Theme\r\n* Array of installed plugins\r\n\r\nIf you have security concerns about displaying this kind of information publicly, fork this repo and remove any of the info you like. Or disable the public route. Or add in some further level of security. Pulls welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\nLive example of this on my site: http://antonioortegajr.com/wp-json/sys_profile/v1/profile\r\n\r\nWP API docs: http://wp-api.org/guides/extending.html\r\n\r\nI have seen other plugins that do a very similar thing. However they don't offer me an REST endpoint to argue against and ultimatly that is why I started this project.\r\n\r\nAny changes and with a little set up, I can know programaticly.\r\n\r\nThe plugins that display this kind of report in WP dash, in an accessable html page, or in an external service are all neat. I just wanted an API enpoint.\r\n\r\nForks and Pulls welcome. And Issues...\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
