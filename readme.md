WP Sys Profile

This plugin creates a custom REST API Endpoint that displays information on the WordPress install and the stack it runs on.

Requires WordPress 4.4 or higher.

No authentication is required
NO sensitive information (usernames, passwords, etc...) is passed. If you need to report sensitive information feel free to fork this repo.
